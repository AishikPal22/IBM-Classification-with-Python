## Course Description

In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

## Topics include

#### Module 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning
- Applications of Machine Learning
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Python libraries suitable for Machine Learning
#### Module 2 - Regression
- Linear Regression
- Non-linear Regression
- Model evaluation methods
#### Module 3 - Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbour
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Model Evaluation
#### Module 4 - Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
Density-Based Clustering
#### Module 5 - Recommender Systems
- Content-based recommender systems
